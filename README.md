# Applied Data Science - Pipelines Project


<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
I chose to do the topic on EDA and model building. Work can be tideaus, there are tons of libraries and syntax which a normal person won't be able to memorize. With your own short-cut work will become more easier. Even as simple as loading the data, checking your data types to building models will be a huge help on completing your work.

<h2> Data </h2>

[Early stage diabetes risk prediction dataset](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/529/early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset)

<p> 
This dataset contains the sign and symptpom data of newly diabetic or would be diabetic patient.

<h2> Data </h2>
The data I used for the pipelines is from Kaggle website. The data is about the study of sleep efficiency and sleep patterns.<br>
