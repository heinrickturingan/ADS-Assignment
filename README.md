<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
I chose to do the topic on EDA and model building. Work can be tideaus, there are tons of libraries and syntax which a normal person won't be able to memorize. With your own short-cut work will become more easier. Even as simple as loading the data, checking your data types to building models will be a huge help on completing your work.
